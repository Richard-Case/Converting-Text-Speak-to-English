#This is a small repository created to store my final assignment from the MVA Python course I completed.

#This program was written using Visual Studio 2017 Community and uses nearly everything that I learned throughout the MVA course; therefor I believe it is an accurate representation of my current level of skill with Python.

####Please critique my work; I'm always looking for feedback and constructive criticism!
