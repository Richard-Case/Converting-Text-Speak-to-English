#This is a small repository created to store my final assignment from the MVA Python course I completed.

#This project comprised nearly everything I learned throughout the course; therefor I believe it is an accurate representation of my current level of skill with Python.

#Please critique my work, I'm always willing looking for feedback and constructive criticism!
